when users enter a link examples /carlbbb /julian /etc

checks the database if that link is valid
if valid creates a webpage with there username,
and makes a website based off the values and objects in the database.




CREATING AN ACCOUNT
    sign up page: gets users: email, password, username, enters that into database at the main object
        when sign up they can use /edit
        in /edit they can edit there website
        like adding links
        changing background colors



figure out what useState useEffect does


        <div>
            <input placeholder="Email..." 
                onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
            />
            <input placeholder="Password ..." 
                onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}
                type="password"
            />
            <button onClick={signIn}>Sign Up</button>
            <button onClick={LogOut}>Log Out</button>
        </div>



First make a log in page and sign up page  
    log in page is already done 
        needs to have validation like 
            if the account is already made says account is already made
            or if there is not @ 
            or if the password is to small 
            if the email is to short or onyly contains numbers
    
    make a different sign up page than log in page
    maybe just need to watch a tutorial on it on youtube

Do more research on reactjs figure out what useState and useEffect those 

need more learning on firebase and the firestore database

ideas for firebase 
    for every user created with sign up they make a document
        inside the document there is a collection inside the collection
            email  
                to probably check if the account is already made
            background color
                can have a wide range of color
                    or a color like rgb thing to pick what color they want to have 
                color for the link
                    extra color for the border of the links
            img for profile picture image
            Name = for the main title in the page
            Description for the Description in the static page

idea 

    make the sign up page require
        email
        password
        username
    
    username is going to be /{username} when linked is type

    if its type with /{username} that is valid its goign to create a static page based on the values given in the firebase database
    if some values are not added yet
        like links
            will be empty
    
when a user has created an account succesfully they can enter /edit

if not they will be blocked out

/edit is where they can add links change there name description and name and profile picture.


for example in my database i have
    carlBBB {
        username: carlbbb,
        email: Carlgbt@gmail.com,
        description: Web Developer,
        profilePicture: myPfp.jpg,

        Links [
            title: my amazon wishlist {link: www.amazon.com},
            title: My tiktok {link: www.tiktok.com},
            title: onlyfans {link: www.onlyfans.com}
        ]
    }
